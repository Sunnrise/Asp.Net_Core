@{
    Layout = null;
}
We crush the _Viewstart layout by setting it to null. This is a common practice when you want to create a page that doesn't use a layout. This is useful when you want to create a page that will be used as a partial view or a page that will be rendered in a modal dialog.
or if we want different layout we can set the that layouts path as normal.
